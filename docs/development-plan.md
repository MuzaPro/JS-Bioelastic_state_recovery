# Development Plan

See the main project README.md for the complete development plan and specifications.

This simplified approach focuses on:
- Cinematic WebM animations
- 5-state interactive navigation
- Mobile-responsive design
- Academic presentation quality

## File Structure
- `css/` - 3 files: variables, base, state-machine
- `js/` - 3 files: config, state-machine, animation-player  
- `assets/animations/` - WebM transition files
- `states/` - Individual state content (if needed)

## Next Steps
1. Create transition animations in Blender/DaVinci
2. Export as WebM files
3. Test state machine functionality
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages
