# Testers response to early versions

## June 4th - Academic Testers

### Testers: 
Baha, Margo, Julia, all with academic degrees in engineering.

### Feedback:
Overall very satisfying smooth experience. 
Mostly enjoyed the continuity between the hand states (1,2 and 3)

Negetive points:
* Expected to be able to click the visuals and have something happen.
* Buttons don't update quickly, feels un-responsive [Fixed]
* Transitions to 'layout' state(4) is too jumpy
* prefer not see compounding transitions between state (like the transition between state 3 and 1 going through state 2 )
* The 'switch' button should really be on the visuals, people really want to click on the 3D model and see something happen
* would welcome a more interactive activity
