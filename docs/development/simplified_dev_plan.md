## 📋 State Machine Specification

### Navigation Flow
```
    (2) ←→ (3)
     ↑     
     ↓   
    (1)
     ↓   
     ↑     
    (4) ←→ (5)
```

### Required Transitions (4 animations needed)
1. **State 1 → State 2**: Transducer on hand → Exploded component view

- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages
- **No frameworks**: Keep it simple and lightweight

### Core JavaScript Modules

#### `js/config.js` - Global Settings
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    STATES: {
        1: { name: 'transducer-on-hand', title: 'Breakthrough Haptic Technology' },
        2: { name: 'exploded-view', title: 'Precision Engineering' },
        3: { name: 'force-diagram', title: 'Interactive Bistable Mechanics' },
        4: { name: 'array-configuration', title: 'Scalable Haptic Arrays' },
        5: { name: 'sensory-demo', title: 'Assistive Technology in Action' }
    },
    TRANSITIONS: {
        '1-2': 'state1-to-state2.webm',
        '2-3': 'state2-to-state3.webm', 
        '1-4': 'state1-to-state4.webm',
        '4-5': 'state4-to-state5.webm'
    },
    ANIMATION: {
        DURATION: 1000, // 1 second
        FPS: 25
    }
};
```

#### `js/state-machine.js` - Core Navigation Logic
```javascript
// Manages current state, transitions, UI updates
// Handles button clicks and state changes
// Updates URL for bookmarkable states
```

#### `js/animation-player.js` - Video Control
```javascript
// Plays WebM transition videos
// Handles video loading and playback events
// Simple video element management
```

### Simplified Architecture
- **Single page application** with dynamic content loading
- **No complex preloading** (browser handles video loading)
- **No memory management** (browser handles video cleanup)
- **Basic responsive design** using CSS Grid and media queries
- **Simple video playback** using HTML5 video elements
