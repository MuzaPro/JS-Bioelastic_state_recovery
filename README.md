# Interactive Haptic Transducer Communication Platform

An interactive web app for the communication of the 2024 Nature publication doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08155-9

An open-source interactive web platform that transforms static scientific publications into immersive, navigable experiences. This project serves as a prototype and template for academic researchers seeking to enhance their scientific communication through interactive storytelling.

## 🔬 About This Project

This interactive platform showcases breakthrough haptic transducer research published in Nature, demonstrating how bistable transducers store energy in compressed skin and enable ultra-low-power haptic feedback systems. The platform features a 5-state interactive state machine that guides users through device mechanics, engineering principles, and real-world applications.

**Live Demo:** [Transducer Introduction](https://muzapro.github.io/practice-zone/bistable_transducer/transducer.html)
